You need to run the server part using python first. it will give websocket at localhost 8080
python videocast.py

Beware there is hard coded media file in the python file. please point it to a meaningful file in your pc before running it.
Please check for VIDEO_FILE_TO_CAST.

Then run the react client which is based on vite and npm. 
npm run dev

The above must have running a server which will give UI screen for the browser.

Now both systems are running. 

take a browser and open the following url. the port number should be corrected with the one listed by the npm server.
http://localhost:5173/

if everything works fine, you can see the media running without audio on the browser.
