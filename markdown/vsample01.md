# A title line
## heading line 
### subheading 

**bold text**
*italicized text*
~~Strikethrough~~

## Space & paragraphing logic:
This is a sample sentence. this is another sentence in the sample paragraph.
If you think sentence as next paragraph, you are wrong. one line-break or enter will be replaced as a space character on same paragraph. I am planning to move next sentence in next paragraph by additing two line-feeds (enter characters) after this sentence.

This is another paragraph.



However, this paragraph after afer a few linebreaks, will not show many linebreaks. It is shown as a consequitive paragraph after a single linebreak.

> blockquote can be done line this.

## list (bulleted)
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## list (numbered)
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

> The dot and space after the number is important.

## Table
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| abcd | efgh |
| aBcde | eFghi |
| Mnop | someText |

## programmer's Code block (monospaced font, like courier new)
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

However, if you want to show a simple code in a paragraph, like `main()`, you can use the shown syntax.
