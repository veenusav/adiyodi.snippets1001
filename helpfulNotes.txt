Creating a react application with vite (French. Prounce as veet)

npm create vite@latest
{
    It prompts for project name, give projectname as the folder to be created.
    then give framework as react and varient as JS. (typescript is also there.)
}
command prompt reappears.
{
    There will be the subfolder. cd to that subfolder.
}
npm install
{
    this will do a few installations. some waring might b there. 
    sample output:
    npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not 
    supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce 
    async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
    npm WARN deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
    npm WARN deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to 
    v9 are no longer supported.
